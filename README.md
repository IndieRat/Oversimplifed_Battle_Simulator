Oversimplified Battle Simulator is in beta.

Click the grid to place units, right click to remove, and mess with the ui

Game made by Dante Swofford who goes by Rumor, trust me its a cool nickname.

Rest in piece, speed controls, you will be missed, after the new update system, the speed system no longer works

Have Fun.
